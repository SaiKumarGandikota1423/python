If in your program you are passing around an object and need to make sure it does not get changed, then a tuple becomes your solution. It provides a convenient source of data integrity.\n",

    "3.Performance\n",
    "    - Lists may have slightly slower performance compared to tuples because they are mutable. Modifying a list requires memory reallocation, which can be slower for large lists.\n",

    "    - List: Lists are used when you need a collection of elements that can change, such as a dynamic list of items or data that needs to be modified.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Tuple: Tuples are used when you need an ordered collection of elements that should not change, such as representing a point in 2D space (x, y), or when you want to ensure the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Memory Usage\n",
    "    - List: Lists generally consume more memory than tuples because they need to store additional information to support their mutability.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Tuple: Tuples consume less memory because they are immutable, and the interpreter can optimize memory usage."
